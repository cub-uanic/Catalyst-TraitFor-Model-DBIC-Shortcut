=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #
    # application class
    #
    package TestApp;

    use Moose;
    use namespace::autoclean;
    use Catalyst qw/ ......... /;
    extends 'Catalyst';
    with 'Catalyst::TraitFor::Model::DBIC::Shortcut';


    #
    # controller class
    #
    package TestApp::Controller::Test;

    .........
        # these two calls are the same
        my $s = $c->model('DB')->schema;
        my $s = $c->db_schema;
    .........
        # these two calls are the same
        my $rs = $c->model('DB::Actor');
        my $rs = $c->db_actor_rs;
    .........


=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you got tired of writting C<< $c->model('DB::Actor') >> each time, or if
you use auto-completion intensively, you could look at this trait.
Just use this role in your application class, and you'll have shortcuts
auto-created for all L<DBIx::Class>-based models:

=over 4

=item - schema

for all schema classes, based on L<Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema>, you'll get
method with name "lowercase class name" + "_schema", with all "::" converted to
underscore ("_"):

    $c->model('DB')->schema         ==>     $c->db_schema
    $c->model('DBIC')->schema       ==>     $c->dbic_schema
    $c->model('DBIC::DB1')->schema  ==>     $c->dbic_db1_schema

=item - resultset

for all resultset classes, based on L<DBIx::Class>, you'll get
method with name "lowercase class name" + "_rs", with all "::" converted to
underscore ("_"):

    $c->model('DB::Actor')          ==>     $c->db_actor_rs
    $c->model('DB::Track')          ==>     $c->db_track_rs
    $c->model('DBIC::DB1::Actor')   ==>     $c->dbic_db1_actor_rs
