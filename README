NAME
    Catalyst::TraitFor::Model::DBIC::Shortcut - shortcuts support for DBIC
    models

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        #
        # application class
        #
        package TestApp;

        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;
        use Catalyst qw/ ......... /;
        extends 'Catalyst';
        with 'Catalyst::TraitFor::Model::DBIC::Shortcut';


        #
        # controller class
        #
        package TestApp::Controller::Test;

        .........
            # these two calls are the same
            my $s = $c->model('DB')->schema;
            my $s = $c->db_schema;
        .........
            # these two calls are the same
            my $rs = $c->model('DB::Actor');
            my $rs = $c->db_actor_rs;
        .........

DESCRIPTION
    If you got tired of writting "$c->model('DB::Actor')" each time, or if
    you use auto-completion intensively, you could look at this trait. Just
    use this role in your application class, and you'll have shortcuts
    auto-created for all DBIx::Class-based models:

    - schema
        for all schema classes, based on Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema,
        you'll get method with name "lowercase class name" + "_schema", with
        all "::" converted to underscore ("_"):

            $c->model('DB')->schema         ==>     $c->db_schema
            $c->model('DBIC')->schema       ==>     $c->dbic_schema
            $c->model('DBIC::DB1')->schema  ==>     $c->dbic_db1_schema

    - resultset
        for all resultset classes, based on DBIx::Class, you'll get method
        with name "lowercase class name" + "_rs", with all "::" converted to
        underscore ("_"):

            $c->model('DB::Actor')          ==>     $c->db_actor_rs
            $c->model('DB::Track')          ==>     $c->db_track_rs
            $c->model('DBIC::DB1::Actor')   ==>     $c->dbic_db1_actor_rs
